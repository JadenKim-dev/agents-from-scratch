    "## Memory in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread-Scoped and Across-Thread Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's worth explaining how [memory works in LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/). LangGraph offers two distinct types of memory that serve complementary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thread-Scoped Memory (Short-term)** operates within the boundaries of a single conversation thread. It's automatically managed as part of the graph's state and persisted through thread-scoped checkpoints. This memory type retains conversation history, uploaded files, retrieved documents, and other artifacts generated during the interaction. Think of it as the working memory that maintains context within one specific conversation, allowing the agent to reference earlier messages or actions without starting from scratch each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Across-Thread Memory (Long-term)** extends beyond individual conversations, creating a persistent knowledge base that spans multiple sessions. This memory is stored as JSON documents in a memory store, organized by namespaces (like folders) and distinct keys (like filenames). Unlike thread-scoped memory, this information persists even after conversations end, enabling the system to recall user preferences, past decisions, and accumulated knowledge. This is what allows an agent to truly learn and adapt over time, rather than treating each interaction as isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "![short-vs-long-term-memory](img/short-vs-long.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Store](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore) is the foundation of this architecture, providing a flexible database where memories can be organized, retrieved, and updated. What makes this approach powerful is that regardless of which memory type you're working with, the same Store interface provides consistent access patterns. This allows your agent's code to remain unchanged whether you're using a simple in-memory implementation during development or a production-grade database in deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph Store\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph offers different [Store implementations](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore) depending on your [deployment](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/deployment/#other-deployment-options):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-Memory (e.g., notebooks)**:\n",
    "   - Uses `from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore`\n",
    "   - Purely a Python dictionary in memory with no persistence\n",
    "   - Data is lost when the process terminates\n",
    "   - Useful for quick experiments and testing\n",
    "   - Semantic search can be configured as shown [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/memory/semantic-search/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Development with `langgraph dev`**:\n",
    "   - Similar to InMemoryStore but with pseudo-persistence\n",
    "   - Data is pickled to the local filesystem between restarts\n",
    "   - Lightweight and fast, no need for external databases\n",
    "   - Semantic search can be configured as shown [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/semantic_search/)\n",
    "   - Great for development but not designed for production use\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LangGraph Platform or Production Deployments**:\n",
    "   - Uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for production-grade persistence\n",
    "   - Fully persistent data storage with reliable backups\n",
    "   - Scalable for larger datasets\n",
    "   - Semantic search can be configured as shown [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/semantic_search/)\n",
    "   - Default distance metric is cosine similarity (customizable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the `InMemoryStore` here in the notebook! "
